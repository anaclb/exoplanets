<b> <u> Classifying exoplanets with machine learning </u> </b>

We aimed to develop a ML algorithm that automatically associates an exoplanet to its type. 

Work done for the curricular unit of Project in Astrophysics at FCUP, under the guidance of researchers Solène Ulmer-Moll and Joao Faria, from CAUP.
